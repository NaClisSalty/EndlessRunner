    Powerups we want:
    1) Make the player bigger
    2) Make the player smaller
    3) Give the player a shield
    4) Increase player speed
    5) Decrease player speed
    6) set player equal to mouse
    7) player automatically shoots objects to hit and destroy obstacles
    8) Mabey one special character that picks one of the above poerups but the effect is permanent
    9) Increase obstacle and powerup speed
    10) Cursor/ Player will now temporarily destroy obstacles on contact (star invincibility from mario)
