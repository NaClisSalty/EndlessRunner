Creative tilt: technical side

We implemented a PID controller for player movement, used same implementation for the x and y axis
Took a lot of work to fine-tune, feel that I gained a lot of knowledge from the process.
Despite the pain, I think it turned out really nicely, so picked it to highlight here
Implementation is in Player.js

Creative tilt: Visual Style and Design
We implemented a story that unfolds as you reach certin point values. A hacker has taken 
over your website and is forcing you to play his crappy endless runner for the lols.
As the game progresses at certin point values the hacker will talk to you through text onscreen.
As the game goes on the hacker will also begin to mess with game mechanics, like the music, the text box textures,
and the players size and speed. I think the visaul story telling and hacker feel of the game came out very well.
I also like how the metaness of the story can add to the visual style.
